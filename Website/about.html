        <p>The main objective in the game is to take a photo of "The Golden Fish",<br/>
            but it has sinked to the bottom of the ocean.<br/>
            On the way there you will meet 3 types of fish:<br/><br/>
            1. Normal fish - They are moving in a straight line.<br/>
            You will lose a heart if you walk into them.<br/><br/>
            2. Hostile fish - If you get too close to them,<br/>
            they will start chasing you.<br/><br/>
            3. Special fish - They work like normal fish,<br/>
            but you can take a photo to get points.<br/>
